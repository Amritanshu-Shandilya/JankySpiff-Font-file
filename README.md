# JankySpiff v1.5
The .ttf file for font based on Zack Freedman's handwriting. 

Download the .ttf font from here by cloning it. And then add it to the software you want to use. 
*Sadly Google docs doesn't support custom .ttf font addition.* But you can add a custom font to MS WORD whose link is provided : [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-a-font-b7c5f17c-4426-4b53-967f-455339c564c1).

You have to research about the tool you want to use. Google will make the task very easy.

I think it could be used with websites too, but I need to try it someday.


### Things to change for  v2.0 -
1. Solve the previous problems
2. Add small letters, digits and special characters
3. Remove the thick boundary from the letters
